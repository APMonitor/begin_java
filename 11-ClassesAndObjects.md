# Lesson 11 - Classes and Objects
One of the things that has allowed technology to advance so much in recent decades is the fact that code can be modular. When a programmer creates a program to perform a specific task, she can package up that code in a convinient bundle for another programmer to use later when he needs to perform a similar task. In object oriented programming languages like Java, these bundles of reusable code are called *classes*. A class is the virtual blueprint of a piece of a program built to perform a specific task. An *object* is a specific virtual bundle of code and information created using the blueprint from a class.

```TCLab``` is a class. When you use the statement ```TCLab myLab = new TCLab();``` What you are really doing is creating an object called 'myLab'. This object is a clone of the TCLab class, it follows the blueprint and structure of the TCLab class exactly but contains information unique to the myLab object. Within one program, you can create many different objects from the same class. Each object will have the same functionality and types of information as specified by the blueprint of the class but will differ slightly in the information stored within. Let's look at an example of how classes and objects can be used to organize and reuse code in a project.
