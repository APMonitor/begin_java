# Lesson 04 - Printing
In the early days of computers, users didn't interact with the computer through a screen, as we do now. Instead, the computer would output information with a teleprinter, like the ones used for wiring long-distance messages.

This method of receiving computer output set the precedence for the most fundamental method of computer output today â€“*printing*. Nowadays, we don't need to print to a physical printer. Instead, output is printed to a *console* on the computer. The console acts like a virtual printer and can print out whatever you tell it to. In addition to writting output, the user can type commands for the computer directly into the console. Because of this, the console is a fundamental and powerful way for programmers to interact with the computer.

## Printing in Java
Every programming language has it's own built in way of printing information to the console. In Java, this is done with the statement ```System.out.println();``` Inside the parentheses, you write the information you want the program to print, for instance,
```
System.out.println("Hello World!");
```
will cause the computer to print the following to the console.
```
Hello World!
```
Try it out for yourself! In a Java project in your IDE, type ```System.out.println("Hello World!");``` then run your project. Try it again, this time replacing "Hello World!" with your own text.

## Printing Variables
Printing wouldn't be very useful if it only let you print out specific text that you already typed into the program. The real utility of printing comes from being able to print out variables. In this way, as your program runs, you can monitor changing variable values. This is very useful in our incubator project because it allow us to monitor the temperature with the two thermometers on the Temperature Control Lab. To print a variable in Java, simply type the name of the variable in the parentheses of the print statement.
```
double temp = 28.57;
System.out.println(temp);
```
The above code will print:
```
28.57
```
Notice that we didn't put quotation marks around ```temp```. Quotation marks tell the program that the text inside is just text. Java sees it as a String datatype. In this case, the command ```System.out.println("temp");``` would just print out ```temp```. Without the quotation marks, java knows to look for a variable named 'temp' and print out the value of that variable.
## Concatenation
There are many cases where you will want to combine two or more pieces of text to print them together. In programming, this combining of text is called *concatenation*. Java does this using the ```+``` operator. When used with two strings, the ```+``` symbol tells Java to combine those into one. We can use this to print more meaningful output to the console.

Take for example a program that simulates a chat conversation with the user. Imagine that the user has input their name and we want the program to respond with a personalized greeting. All we have to do is save the user's name to a variable and concatenate it with the rest of the sentence we want to print. In a real program, we would code it to take input from the user every time the program is run but, to simplify things a little bit, we will hard code the name into a variable like so:
```
String name = "Gordon"
System.out.println("Hi, " + name + ". Thanks for chatting today!");
```
The result of the above code is the following:
```
Hi, Gordon. Thanks for chatting today!
```
## Type Casting
Keep in mind that you can only concatenate together two strings. If you try and concatenate two integers or doubles,  Java will interperate the ```+``` as an arethmetic opperator and add the two numbers together. In order to concatenate number variables, you must first convert them to strings. The classes of each datatype have built in ways of doing this conversion. To convert from an integer to a string in Java, you can use the method ```Integer.toString();``` Here's an example using this method:
```
int num_eggs = 4;
System.out.print;n("The incubator contains " + Integer.toString(num_eggs) + " eggs.");
```
This code will output
```
The incubator contains 4 eggs.
```
This conversion from one datatype to another is called *type casting*. Whenever you combine or add or multiply values of different datatypes, it is important to first cast them to the same datatype or else Java will give you an error.
## Let's Try It!
Let's apply what we've learned so far to some code that we could use in our incubator project. Your task is to write a short program that will print the temperatures of both thermometers 1 and 2 to the console. Although the values for your thermometers will differ from these, your output should be formatted like this:
```
Temperature 1: 24.02
Temperature 2: 23.98
```
In addition to the basic settup of a Java project, covered in lesson 00, you will need to do the following things that we have covered in previous lessons:

Import the ```jtclab``` package;
```
import edu.jtclab.*;
```
Create a ```JTCLab``` object
```
JTCLab myLab = new JTCLab();
```
You will also need to use ```T1();``` and ```T2();``` functions to read the temperatures from the two thermometers. The following code is an example of how to read one of the temeratures and store it to a variable, assuming you've named your ```JTCLab``` object 'myLab'.
```
double temp1 = myLab.T1();
```
Good luck!
