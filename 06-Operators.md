# Operators
At it's core, programming is really just extra powerful mathematics. Because everything a computer does is really some extention of math, operators in a programming language are core to it's functionality. You are familiar with the idea of operators from mathematics. An operator represents some transformative or informative action that is happening to a set of data. For instance, in the equation ```4 + 7 = 11``` we see the use of two operators, ```+``` and ```=```. the ```+ ```operator *transforms* the data on either side of it, adding them together. The ```=``` operator *informs* us that the data on the left side is equal to the data on the right side. We have already used operators in a few of the lesson activities, today, we are going to take a look at three common kinds of opperators in Java and how they are used.

## Arithmetic Operators
You will be familiar with the majority of arithmetic operators as they are mathematical operators. They can be used to perform operations on any numerical data â€“integers, doubles, floats etc. The arithmetic operators in java are:
|   |                |
|---|----------------|
| + | Addition       |
| - | Subtraction    |
| * | Multiplication |
| / | Devision       | 
| % | Modulus        | 

The last listed operator, modulus, will return the remainder after deviding the number on the left by the number on the right. For instance, ```23 % 7``` will equate to ```2```. These operators can be used in any instance when you want to perform mathematical operations on values in your code. You can set a variable equal to the product of two other variables like this:
```
int a = 2;
int b = 3;
int c = a + b;
System.out.println(c);
```
```
5
```
Or calculate the remainder of the devision of two variables like this:
```
int a = 239;
int b = 17;
int c = a % b;
System.out.println(c);
```
```
1
```
Just like in regular mathematics, you can use parentheses to tell the computer which operations to do first.
```
int a = (2+3) - (10-3);
System.out.println(c);
```
```
-2
```

## Relational Operators
Relational operators are used to determine the relationship between values of different pieces of data. You could use a relational operator to test weather ther temperature of the TCLab is above a miminum tempurature. The relational operators in java are:
|   |                |
|---|----------------|
| == | Equals|
| != | Not Equals|
| > | Greater Than|
| < | Less Than |
| >=| Greater Than or Equal to |
| <=| Less Than or Equal to|

All of these opperations result in either true or false, boolean data. Let's look at the use of a few of these operators in real Java code, along with the printed output.

```
boolean isEqual = (7 == 18);
System.out.println(isEqual);
```
```
false
```
You can use arithmetic operators and relational operators in the same equation.
```
boolean isEqual = (7+4 == 11);
System.out.println(isEqual);
```
```
true
```
The greater/less than opperators are used like this:
```
boolean isGreater = (7+4 > 11);
System.out.println(isGreater);
```
```
false
```
The ```>=``` and ```<=``` operators function similarly but will also return true if the two sides equal one another:
```
boolean isGreater = (7+4 >= 11);
System.out.println(isGreater);
```
```
true
```

## Logical Operators
Logic operators are used in boolean operations, operations that equate to either true or false. The logic operators in Java are:
|   |                |
|---|----------------|
| && | And|
| \|\| | Or|
| ! |  Not | 

Let's look at how each of these logical operators function in Java code.

### The And Operator

```&&``` returns ```true``` if the boolean values on both sides of it are true:
```
boolean myBool = true && true;
System.out.println(myBool);
```
```
true
```
 ```&&```  returns ```false``` if one or more boolean values on both sides of it are false:
```
boolean myBool = false && true;
System.out.println(myBool);
```
```
false
```

### The Or Operator

```&&``` returns ```true``` if at least one of the values on both sides of it are true:
```
boolean myBool = false && true;
System.out.println(myBool);
```
```
true
```
 ```&&```  returns ```false``` if neither of the boolean values on both sides of it are true:
```
boolean myBool = false && false;
System.out.println(myBool);
```
```
false
```

### The Not Operator

The not operator effectively reverses the value of the boolean right after it as you can see below:
```
boolean myBool = !true;
System.out.println(myBool);
```
```
false
```

## Combining Operators
You can combine any of the operators we have talked about in this lesson to create complex logical statements. For instance, let's say that you want to write a program that will test weather your combined expenses from different categories is within your monthly budget. You could use both relational and arithmetic operators like this:
```
float gasolineCost = 37.50;
float entertainmentCost = 12.00;
float foodCost = 150.75;
float budgetMax = 210.00;

bool isOverBudget = (gasolineCost + entertainmentCost + foodCost) <= budgetMax;
System.out.println(isOverBudget);
```
When you run this program with these values, Java will print out:
```
false
```
Congradulations! You're living within your budget!

## Try it Yourself
For this lesson's activity, your task is to extend the program you wrote in lesson 04 to test weather the temperatures from thermometer 1 and thermometer 2 on the Temperature Control Lab are equal to one another. Your program should print out two lines as output, formated like the ones below:
```
Temperature 1: 24.02
Temperature 2: 23.98
Are the temperatures equal?
false
The difference is:
0.04
```
