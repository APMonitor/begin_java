# Final Project

This final project is an opportunity for you to use the skills you've learned in this course to build a temperature control program that works like an egg incubator. Feel free to look back through the previous lessons as you remember and apply each of these skills.

It's wise to begin by planning out the general functionality of your program. You can write comments in your project that explain in plain words what your code should do, this is called pseudocode. Then you can go along step by step and write the code to do each part.

## Your program

Your program should maintain the temperature of heater 1 (T1) at 37Â°C by adjusting the heater (Q1) over the course of 10 minutes. The LED should turn on whenever the temperature is being adjusted. Save a list of temperatures and of heater 1 values that can be printed out at the end of 10 minutes.

Remember to test your program after every little addition. You don't have to test it for a full 10 minutes.

Good luck!
